## Rough Draft
In June of 2015 I joined MaxYZ (MaxCDN Labs) lead by my good friend and mentor David Henzel.
* Part of labs was thinking of new ways to drive traffic to MaxCDN
* Links on Open Source projects (BootstrapCDN, Font Awesome, jQuery) brought in 8% of our referral traffic
* I always thought `README.md` was a great way to promote something relevant.
* kept seeing awesome list around
* I also found myself Googling "json datasets" a lot for various reasons.
* "Why not create an awesome list for json datasets?"
* [So I did](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets/commit/b5e57eb10f5fc27a8c58162f236c81a3f66eaf0c)
* I then sent it to all my nerd friends
* They weren't too energetic.
* My hopes of this hitting the front page of HN was not looking great.
* Once I had some stars, I submitted it to Awesome.
* Got more stars, but the referral traffic was minimal.
* If you look at the [license section](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets#license) you will see "MaxCDN has waived all...", I left that in as a reminder of how much I will always love MaxCDN.
* While the experiment failed, it inspired us to [start advertising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jiIeTwDKhs&feature=youtu.be&t=12m6s) in README's.
